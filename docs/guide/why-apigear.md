# Why APIGear

APIGear offers a fresh approach to software contracts. We believe in an interface drive development to successfully drive the software modularization. 

When working in small or large teams it is always crucial to define your interface as base for a shared work effort. Either as part of a subcontractor contract or as a work base for distributed teams. Even when working inside the same team a common understanding how to split the work should be captured in an interface description.

Starting a new project is always a challenge. It is so hard to get the split between teams or even inside team correct. Teams have to wait for other teams to finish their work due to dependencies. Miscommunication of interfaces creates delay and often requires last minute changes. Integration of modules it is still a very stress full and complicated work.

## Direct Benefits

* Clean documentation of work split, usable for contracting
* Participants have common understand what to build and how to build
* Code generation removes burden of infrastructure coding and lets team focus on features
* Tracking of work progress by tracking API implementations
* Concurrent development using API mocks
* Contract validation using test scenarios
* Clean architecture


## Developer Value

Express your interfaces using a high-level description language and ensure all APIs use the same architecture, developed by industry experts. Focus on features. Do not feel guilty late in a project because you did not had the time to define clean interfaces and abstractions. Often developers are pressed for features and do not take their time to abstract modules from each others. This will start hurting later in the project when complexity increases and testing gets harder.


## Management Value

Get a clear overview of the status of the API design and implementation status. Give your team all information required to work together. Be able to report the progress to your stakeholders. Do not get surprised about projects slowing down when complexity increases. Let your developers focus on features and not on infrastructure coding.

## Business Value

Accelerate your project and feel comfortable to reach milestones more predictable. Get insights about API usage and API reuse inside your company or across clients.
