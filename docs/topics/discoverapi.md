# Discovering APIs

APIGears is designed to be an API hub for people coming together to share APIs and to discover new APIs. You can search for APIs using the epxlore feature of APIGears.

When you create an API you can enter tags to categorize your API. And if you made your API public the API can be discovered by the whole community. A private API can be discovered by your team.

When you found an API you like you can link it into your project. At this stage you can not edit this API other wise the link would be broken. If you decice to edit the API the link will be changed to a reference so that people know where the original API came from and that you changed it.

It is currently not possible to monetize your APIs. This is soemthing we could think about. Also a link is connected to a specific version of the API. To change the version you can edit version connected with the link.

We hope we will be able to create a thrifing community which will develop new creative APIs for different markets.

To be able to generate code for an API you need to link it into your project and use one of your configured runners.
